# ArtExhibitionWebsite
The website is the place to showcase my art works.
The art works are 3D animation videos which are animated in Blender.
Then the website was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that users can interact to choose the journey they want to follow based on given scenes.
The website was host by University of Victoria host server.
