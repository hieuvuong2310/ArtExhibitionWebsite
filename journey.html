            <h3> Welcome to my webpage.</h3>
                <p> This website is for users/viewers to interact with website to decide which scene they want to visit and create your own story/feeling based on the available scenes.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3> How to use </h3>
                <p> As a user you can have a choice to choose which scene you want to go next by clicking to the drop-down list and choose the scene you want</p>
                <p> However, I decided to keep the scene anonymous. You will not know what the next scene you choose is about until you choose to visit it. </p>

                <h3> Character </h3>
                <p> This brown bear will be the main character in all scenes. I chose it because I wanted to keep the consistence of all my videos.</p>
                <p> Why brown bear? Because it is related to my childhood, and till now. I am attracted to this cute character. I also want to reflect myself, my interest in my artwork. But this time, I will not make a fixed artwork, I make an interactive art, where viewers can decide what my artwork will be.</p>
